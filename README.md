# DL-ByT5
Deep learning project within NLP using the ByT5 model to grammatical error correction.


The ByT5 has been fine-tuned with a sentence-2-sentence approach.

The danish model that Samual and Straka [https://github.com/ufal/multilexnorm2021] has been fine-tuned with a masked-word-2-word approach.

The data that we have fine-tuned with are not public, hence we can only upload dummy sentences. 

sentence-2-sentence approach:
- Cleaning, dataframes, pickles
- Training
- Inferring
- Evaluation
- Visualisation

masked-word-2-word approach:
- Load data
- Training
